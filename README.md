# Introduction

This project is part of a challenge from Front-end Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).
The goal here is to create an application where the countries are displayed and it is possible to access their details, and also to provide a switch between dark and light themes.
For development, the main stacks used are Vite and TypeScript; React using Context API was picked for creating the components and TailWind CSS for their styling. For the countries information
the API used is the REST Countries (https://restcountries.com/), and Axios was used for fetching data.
